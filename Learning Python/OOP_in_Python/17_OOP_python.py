# In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that group together data (attributes) 
# and behavior (methods) under a single structure.

# 🧱 Think of a Class Like a Template
# Just like a blueprint for a house, a class defines:
# - What data an object should have (e.g., name, age)
# - What it can do (e.g., speak, move)
# You then create instances (objects) from that class.


# 🧱 Basic Class Syntax
# class ClassName:
#     def __init__(self, param1, param2):
#         self.param1 = param1
#         self.param2 = param2

#     def method_name(self):
#         # method body
#         pass
